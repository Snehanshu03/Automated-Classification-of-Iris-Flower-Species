# Automated-Classification-of-Iris-Flower-Species


## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict the species of **Iris flowers** based on their measurements.

The goal is to classify an Iris flower into one of three species:

* *Setosa*
* *Versicolor*
* *Virginica*

using the famous **Iris dataset** included in the `scikit-learn` library.

## üõ† Workflow

1. **Loading the Dataset**

   * The built-in Iris dataset from `scikit-learn` is loaded.

2. **Data Preparation**

   * Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
   * Target: Species name (mapped from numeric labels for readability)

3. **Data Splitting**

   * Dataset is split into **training** and **testing** sets.

4. **Model Training**

   * A **Decision Tree Classifier** is trained on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**

   * Accuracy score and classification report are generated for test data.

6. **Prediction**

   * Model predicts the species of a new, unseen Iris flower from its measurements.

## üì¶ Requirements

* Python **3.6+**
* scikit-learn
* pandas

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas
```
