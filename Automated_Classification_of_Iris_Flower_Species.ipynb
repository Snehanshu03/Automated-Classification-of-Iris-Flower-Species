        "# Iris Flower Classification with Decision Tree\n",
        "\n",
        "This project demonstrates how to use a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into one of three species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica, using the well-known Iris dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "The workflow includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Loading the Dataset**: The Iris dataset, which is included in the scikit-learn library, is loaded.\n",
        "2.  **Data Preparation**: The data is split into features (measurements) and the target (species). The target variable is mapped from numerical representation to actual species names for better readability.\n",
        "3.  **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model.\n",
        "4.  **Model Training**: A Decision Tree Classifier is trained on the training data.\n",
        "5.  **Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated on the test data using accuracy and a classification report.\n",
        "6.  **Prediction**: The model is used to predict the species of a new, unseen Iris flower based on its measurements.\n",
